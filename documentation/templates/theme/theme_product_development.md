# Theme 1.0: Product Development
## Overview
As a contributor to the MyWebClass.org project, I want to set a solid foundation for a high-quality, functional website. 
By implementing an Agile project management framework and DevOps processes, the team can efficiently develop the website 
template and ensure that it satisfies all necessary technical and legal requirements, is optimized for search engines, 
and is completed on time and within budget. By following lean and agile principles, we can quickly and effectively meet 
business requirements, setting us up for long-term success.
