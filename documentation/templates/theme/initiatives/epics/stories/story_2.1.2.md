"As a software developer, I want to use a Continuous Delivery (CD) process to automatically deploy code changes to 
staging and production environments so that I can deliver features to users quickly."

Acceptance Criteria:

The CD process should be set up to automatically deploy code changes to staging and production environments.
The CD process should be integrated with the development workflow and should not require manual intervention from developers.
The CD process should include a comprehensive set of automated tests that cover all critical aspects of the codebase and ensure that the code changes are ready for deployment.
The CD process should have clear deployment policies and procedures in place, including rollback plans in case of errors or issues.
The CD process should provide clear and actionable feedback to developers on how to resolve deployment issues and improve the deployment process.
The CD process should be well-documented and easily accessible to all developers.
The CD process should be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that it is meeting the needs of the development team.
The CD process should help to improve the speed and reliability of feature delivery to users while minimizing the risk of errors and downtime.
